# CrowdWaterDashboard
A Dashboard to display the stats of the CrowdWater Citizen Science Project

Coded in RStudio using R 3.6.1,
Last Update: 01.10.2019

This is my first GitHub repository about the CrowdWater Dashboard. I made this to not be asked by my supervisors about current stats of the project all the time. They can just have a look at the dashboard by themselves. Prolem: solved.

01.10.2019 11:52: I now connected the project to my RStudio.
